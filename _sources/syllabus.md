# ADSC 4910 - Applied Data Science Integrated Practice 3
This course will provide the opportunity for students to apply and practice their data science skills by working on practical exercises. The course consists of weekly worksheets that help reinforce students' understanding and technical know-hows. We will focus on the application of machine learning, data mining, and multivariate statistics for data science.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, students are expected be able to:
- Understand and apply the fundamentals of supervised machine learning covering concepts such as: train/test split, cross validation, feature engineering, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.
- Understand and apply basic deep learning techniques such as: neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation, optimization, RNN, CNN, transformers

## Peer teaching

In this course, each group will take turn to give a lecture on an assigned topic to the whole class. The purpose of peer teaching is to help reinforce your understanding by requiring you to process and articulate the material actively. Instead of just passively listening, you will engage with the content more deeply and identify any areas where you may need clarification. By explaining concepts to others, you also reinforce your own learning and gain a better understanding of how the material fits together.

## Assessment overview

| Assessment component    | Weight | Deadline |
|-------------------------|--------|---------|
| Teamwork contract       |     N/A |Jan 14, 2025, 11:59 PM|
| Attendance      |     10% |N/A|
| Lecture quality      |     20% |Before the lecture that you are in charge of|
| Worksheet (7% each x 10)|     70% |Every Tuesday's midnight|

## Expectations for the lecture
- Each lecture should be within 75 minutes
- The lecture should have clear learning objectives
- The lecture should have at least 3 active learning activities (e.g., a short discussion activity, a poll, a small in-class exercise). The purpose of these activities is to help students actively engage with the learning materials instead of just passively listening.

## Attendance, late assignments, academic concessions, academic accomodation

### Attendance

- We will take attendance during the first 5 minutes of each class. 
- **If you are late more than 5 minutes, it will be counted as absent**. 
- Attendance will account up to 10% of the course total grade. 
- You are **allowed to miss 3 classes** without incurring any penalty. 

Please refer to [TRU's attendance policy](https://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/Policy_ED_03-135351.pdf). In addition, we will take attendance during class via Moodle's QR code

### Academic concessions
If you encounter situations that may impede your ability to meet course requirements—such as illness, family emergencies, or other significant life events—please notify the instructor **at least 24 hours before deadline**. Academic concessions, including extensions or alternative assessments, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You may be required to provide documentation to support your request. Concession requests after the deadline has passed will likely be refused. 

### Late Assignments
Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 25% per day, up to a maximum of 75%. After 3 days, late assignments will no longer be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Extensions may be granted in exceptional circumstances, provided that you contact the instructor before the deadline.

### Accessbility
Students registered with the Accessibility Services who require accommodations must provide their Letter of Accommodation to the instructor as soon as possible. This letter will outline the necessary accommodations to ensure an equitable learning environment. Please ensure that this is done early in the term to facilitate timely arrangements.
